This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It's common when dealing with asynchronous data fetching where the data might not be available immediately. For example, if you try to render `user.name` before `user` is populated with data from an API call, you'll get this error.

```javascript
// Example: Incorrect way to render user name before data is fetched
const MyComponent = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/user')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setUser(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <Text>{user.name}</Text> // This will cause the error if user is null
  );
};
```
